## LearningsðŸ¥‡

I am glad to have got the chance and opportunity to be a part of the Google Season of Docs 2021 program organized by Google. The learning curve in the whole journey has been high. The program has helped me to:
* Understand the importance of Technical documentation.
* Learn about Docusaurus and MDX(Markdown+ReactJS).
* Learn about RPA (Robotic Process Automation) bots.
* Get involved in an innovative community that is  Wechaty.
## AcknowledgementsðŸŽ‰

I am thankful to **[Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs)** and **[Wechaty](https://wechaty.js.org/)** for giving me this opportunity. I would also like to thank my mentors [Huan LI](https://github.com/huan) and [Li Jiarui](https://github.com/lijiarui) and volunteers [Simin Liao](https://github.com/proudofsimin) and [Rohitesh Kumar Jain](https://github.com/Rohitesh-Kumar-Jain) for their constant support, they led the video meetings in a well-organized, interactive manner and for making the meetings a  great platform for discussion.

## Future PlansðŸŽ†

* Continue to work towards contributing to Wechaty community.
* Detect and rectify issues in implementation of the RPA bot if any in the future.
