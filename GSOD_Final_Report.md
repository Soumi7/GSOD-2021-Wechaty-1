I am glad to have got the chance and opportunity to be a part of the Google Season of Docs 2021 program organized by Google. The learning curve in the whole journey has been high. The program has helped me to:
* Understand the importance of Technical documentation.
* Learn about Docusaurus and MarkdownX(Markdown+ReactJS).
* Learn about RPA (Robotic Process Automation) bots.
* Get involved in an innovative community that is  Wechaty.
