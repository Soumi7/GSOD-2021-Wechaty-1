## Introduction

This is the project proposal for **Improve the Wechaty References** on which we will be working as a part of **Google Season of Docs 2021.** Soumi and I  have proposed our timeline to complete this work during a span of **17 weeks**.
User docs are an important feature of any software product it assists the end-users in using the software poftware product or a service.The excellent user docs site is a sign of the healthiness of the product, the developer team.The good user documentation makes the product or a service easy to use .

## Current state of References Page

After analysis of the introduction section, following issues were seen:

* The references page is difficult to understand for first time users technically.
* It is incomplete ,abstract and outdated.
* Many information is given in Chinese language and hence difficult for  global users to understand.

## Project scope

References contain the technical reference for APIs and other technical aspects of the Wechaty machinery.It describes how it works and the way it works. The scope of this project is limited to improving the References section of the wechaty.js.org website.

## Project GoalsðŸŽ¯

* Make a neat index to search through the references section with ease
* Building a step by step guide for references
* Add snippets wherever possible with appropriate images to make it look more attractive.
* Include more use cases
* Add English translations to already existing Chinese language information
* Focus on concrete steps
* At end of our project tenure we will definitely make the Reference page perfect & top-notch

## Team Goalsâ›³
* Weekly phone calls with each other for discussion
* Also setup a personalized channel for small discussions
* Check each otherâ€™s work and help out
* Set weekly goals together during the phone calls
